  My name is Timmo Mustonen. I grew up in a small country called Estonia. Growing up, I have always enjoyed everything creative. I started with taking and editing pictures (which is still my current passion to this day) and ended with making my first homepage, which I created in primary school as a final graduation assignment. My passion to it sky-rocketed even more, when I first got my hands on the Web Developer Online Course by Colt Steele, where I learned basics of front- and back-end developing. Eventually, when I got taste of it, I was eager to learn more about it.
